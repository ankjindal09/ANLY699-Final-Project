How are businesses affected by adverse cyber incidents
This paper is about the growing menace of cybersecurity in today’s business world where numerous cybersecurity incidents have plagued many industries causing widespread disruption and legal ramifications, hence it makes this topic a very important topic. This need to understand this is accentuated if we consider how interconnected we are with the digital ecosystem. 
In my proposal, I aim to provide evidence that cybersecurity is not just an IT issue it is also a business issue and that it can adversely affect an organization’s brand reputation and customer confidence. To carry this out, data will be collected on the type of cyber incident, its impact on the consumers, what impact did it have on the business. To further my analysis, apart from literature review, I will be running regressions and correlations using R and will try to provide evidence to my hypothesis, which will prove that cybersecurity incidents do affect businesses.
